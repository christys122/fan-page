   <h3>Bio</h3>
   <p>Shawn James was born & raised In Chicago, IL.  He grew up on the south side where he attended and sang in a gospel church.
    He started releasing his own music in 2012 and hasn’t stopped since.  "I play a wide range of music from folk to blues, r&b, 
    Gospel to rock, metal & alotta things in between.  It’s all done with emotion, feeling, heart & a lotta soul".  He is currently touring Europe.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>I </strong>first heard of Shawn James through a youtube link sent to me by a friend.  I was blown away by his cover of Iron Maiden's 
        "Number of the Beast".  I had to find out what else this person covered.  Turns out it is quite a bit and he does them with so much soul and 
        feeeling.  His cover of John Legend's "Who Did that to You" really gets you.  His original works range from Blues to Rock to Gospel.  His song "Delilah" and "Burn the Witch" are two of my all time favorites. 
        I missed the opportunity to see him live in March of 2020; not due to the pandemic, but to a business trip.  I flew out the day before the concert.  It was a tough choice.  </p>
